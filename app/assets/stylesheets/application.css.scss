 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files

 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.

// RAILSCAST 268
// RBATES recommends not relying on 'require_tree .' because it compiles
// into individual CSS files and does not carry over Sass variables.
// Also, there's no way to tell the LOAD-ORDER of your style sheets.
// If we import each of our Sass files, we can solve both problems.
// This may seem tedious as we add many files, but there's another
// video explaining how to further organize stylesheets, and import
// a single file (for each model) rather than importing all the indiviual.
// More on that soon.

// TIP!
// You can check if your Sass compiles correctly by viewing your
// stylesheet on localhost:3000/assets/your_stylesheet_here.css
